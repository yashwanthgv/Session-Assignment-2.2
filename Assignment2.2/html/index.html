        <h2>CSS3</h2>
        <p>CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1. It brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts. Experimental parts are vendor-prefixed and should either be avoided in production environments, or used with extreme caution as both their syntax and semantics can change in the future</p>

            <h3>CSS3 Modules and the standardization process</h3>
            <p>CSS Level 2 needed 9 years, from August 2002 to June 2011 to reach the Recommendation status. This was due to the fact that a few secondary features held back the whole specification. In order to accelerate the standardization of non-problematic features, the CSS Working Group of the W3C, in a decision referred as the Beijing doctrine, divided CSS in smaller components called modules . Each of these modules is now an independent part of the language and moves towards standardization at its own pace. While some modules are already W3C Recommendations, other still are early Working Drafts. New modules are also added when new needs are identified.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>CSS modules status</h3>
            <p>A few CSS modules are already fairly stable and have reached one of the three recommendation level of the CSSWG: Candidate Recommendation, Proposed Recommendation or Recommendation. These can be used without prefix and are pretty stable, though a few features can still be dropped at the Candidate Recommendation stage.</p>

        <h2>HTML5</h2>
        <p>HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors,</li>
        <li>and a larger set of technologies that allows more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. This set is sometimes called HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Designed to be usable by all Open Web developers, this reference page links to numerous resources about HTML5 technologies, classified into several groups based on their function.

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
